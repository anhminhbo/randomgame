# RandomGame
# Clone this to your computer using : "git clone (http or ssh under Code)", open your IDE, use terminal and type in "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the required packages
# Open using an IDE(Pycharm)
# randomgame.py is a system input that user can input their range numbers for the game. Using Terminal command and cd to the right folder
# After that, write: randomgame.py 1 100 --> which means run randomgame and add the first number to be 1 and the last number to 100 --> start the game to guesse between 1 and 100.( Got hint for you)
# You can start at whatever number you like, your choice to test your luck xD.

Notes: added test.py to unittest the system, added script.py for only scripting
